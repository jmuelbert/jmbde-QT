Introduction to jmbde
*********************

jmbde is a program for the management of resources in companies. with this
program, employees and the equipment they need for their work can be
recorded. These are computers, printers and telephones.

jmbde use the cross-platform framework [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/),
which means it works with the most operating systems.

The program uses the [QT library](https://www.qt.io). Therefore it can be used
on almost any platform. It runs under MacOS, Linux and Windows. Basically, an
installer should be used to install the program on a computer. This installer
will install on the required QT libraries. For the use of the program with
Windows as operating system this is absolutely necessary.
With Linux and macOS you can use a different version.  QT can be installed
centrally on these two operating systems. With these two operating systems, only
the actual program files are then installed. But here, too, there are complete
installation packages with everything, including QT.
