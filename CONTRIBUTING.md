# Contributing to jmbde #

First time contributing to jmbde-QT ?
Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jmuelbert/jmbde-QT/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

All kinds of contributions are very appreciated, be it documentation, code or
build system improvements, be it a small patch, a feature or maybe even becoming
a co-maintainer of jmbde. Bug reports and feature requests are of course welcome
too!

## Reporting an Issue ##

Make sure to mention the following things:

- How the issue can reproduced
- What behavior you expected instead
- What actually happened
- jmbde version, operating system, etc. if possibly relevant.

Also, please consider adding a screenshot or video if it helps illustrate the issue.

## Requesting a Feature ##

First of all, look around the already open issues to see if the feature was
already requested in some form. In that case it's better to comment on the
existing feature instead.

In any case, be sure to describe the feature in enough detail, to consider its
implications on existing parts of the software if relevant and to describe how
it would help you in particular. Also, please consider including a mockup if the
issue includes UI changes.

## Submitting a Patch ##

- Ideally, start with something small to get familiar with the review process and
  work up from there.
- Make an effort to follow the overal coding style, which is roughly based on
  the [Qt Creator coding style](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/coding-style.html).
- Be prepared for detailed feedback on your patch and to make several revisions.
- Each pull request will be built automatically for Windows, Linux and macOS. If
  the build fails anywhere, please check if it may be a problem with your patch.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!
