## About jmbde

jmbde uses the cross platform framework [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/),
which means that it works with most operating systems.

computer. This installation program is executed on the required QT libraries. For the
use of the program with Windows as operating system is absolutely necessary. With Linux
and macOS can be used on another variant. For these two operating systems QT can be
installed centrally. With these two operating systems only the actual program files are
installed. But also here there are complete installation packages with everything,
including QT.

## Create program

In the following you will find hints for developers how to use jmbde on your native
system. They are not complete guides, but contain information on the necessary measures.
libraries, compile flags, etc.

### Dependencies

- The program requires qt5 from version 5.12.9
- cmake from version 3.13.3
- ninja
- c++ development system

#### On macOS

- The latest Xcode version.
- Brew [installation guide](https://brew.sh)

```bash
  brew install cmake
  brew install ninja
  brew install qt5
  brew link qt5 --force
```

- Alternatively, you can also
    [download Qt here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)

Run 'cmake' to create jmbde:

#### For the release version

```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ...
        cmake --build . --target install
        cpack .
```

#### For the debug version

```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
        cmake --build .
```

### on Windows

- Visual Studio 2017 or higher
- You can download [Qt here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- You can install many tools with choco.
    [installation guide](https://chocolatey.org/install#installing-chocolatey)

```cmd
  choco install cmake
  choco install ninja
```

#### For the release version

```cmd
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" ....
        cmake --build . --target install
        cpack .
```

#### For the debug version

```cmd
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
        cmake --build .
```

### on Linux

- On Ubuntu/Debian:
    `sudo apt install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools zlib1g-dev qtdeclarative5-dev cmake ninja`.
- On Fedora: `sudo dnf builddep jmbde-QT cmake ninja`.
- On Arch Linux: `pacman -S qt cmake ninja`

The installed toolchains must match the one with which Qt was compiled.

- Next you compile by executing:

#### For the release version

```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ...
        cmake --build . --target install
        cpack .
```

#### For the debug version

```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
        cmake --build .
```

You can now start 'jmbde' with the command 'bin/jmbde' from the command line.
