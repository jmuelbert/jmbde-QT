# MSDO installs, configures and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools
# (including, but not limited to, SDL/security and compliance tools).
#
# The Microsoft Security DevOps action is currently in beta and runs on the windows-latest queue,
# as well as Windows self hosted agents. ubuntu-latest support coming soon.
#
