        Thanks for your interest in jmbde-QT ü¶úÔ∏èüîó!

        Please follow these instructions, fill every question, and do every step. üôè

        We're asking for this because answering questions and solving problems in GitHub takes a lot of time --
        this is time that we cannot spend on adding new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation or reviewing pull requests.

        By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier for us to help you.

        There's a high chance that by following this process, you'll find the solution on your own, eliminating the need to submit a question and wait for an answer. üòé

        As there are many questions submitted every day, we will **DISCARD** and close the incomplete ones.

        That will allow us (and others) to focus on helping people like you that follow the whole process. ü§ì

        Relevant links to check before opening a question to see if your question has already been answered, fixed or
        if there's another way to solve your problem:

          * Read open questions until I find 2 where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.
          * I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
          * Once my question is answered, I will mark the answer as "accepted".

      description: |
        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.

        If a maintainer can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance that you'll be able to get help.

        **Important!**

        * Use code tags (e.g., ```python ... ```) to correctly [format your code](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting).
        * INCLUDE the language label (e.g. `python`) after the first three backticks to enable syntax highlighting. (e.g., ```python rather than ```).
        * Reduce your code to the minimum required to reproduce the issue if possible. This makes it much easier for others to help you.
        * Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.
